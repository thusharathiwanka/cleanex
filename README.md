## Project Description

Cleanex is a laundry and cleaning company, which provides laundry services to their customers and save customer’s valuable time with allowing
user to make their laundry with a high responsibility. When a customer wants to use Cleanex's services, they must bring their laundry items to
the company premises. Some clothing materials may reject by the company due to the low quality and in that case, the client may have to deal
with certain time-consuming difficulties. As a result, management has come up with a great solution which is a web application that user can
access whenever or wherever they want and check whether the company is able to provide service according to their requirements. For the
convenience of the customer, management decided to introduce a delivery service to collect the laundry item from the customer and again deliver
the item to the customer's doorstep when the laundry service is completed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node JS should be installed

### Running the project

- In the project directory, you can run below commands to install the dependencies and run the app:

  1. ### `cd backend && npm install` - install backend dependencies
  2. ### `cd frontend && npm install` - install frontend dependencies
  3. ### `cd backend && npm start` - start the backend server
  4. ### `cd frontend && npm start` - start the frontend

### Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

In the backend directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the backend server.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run devStart`

Runs the backend server on development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the jest test runner. This will run all the tests inside the api/tests/ directory.
